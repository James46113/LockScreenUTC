Enables you to lock your screen. It can be unlocked with a password.

- Place all of the files in the same folder
- Run "Encrypt Password.exe" and enter your password
- Run "Lock Screen.exe" in the same folder as "pw.txt" that "Encrypt Password.exe" made

If your put a file called "bg.png" or "bg.jpg" in the same folder as "Lock Screen.exe" then that will be the background for the lock screen
